/**
 * **NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE.**
 *
 * GAP uses Mustache for templating. This is fast and lightweight, but does not
 * support data transformation. Coupled with the lack of custom Javascript in
 * GAP, this means data has to provided exactly as needed from the source API.
 * In practice, this is not always possible. And it is not desirable for quick
 * development and testing.
 *
 * To solve this problem, GAP allows registering of a proxy. This allows pattern
 * matching on requests, to transform data before it is returned from source.
 *
 * Register the proxy *after* gap-core but *before* other extensions.
 *
 * Transform functions have the potential to be very slow if operating on larger
 * data structures so care is needed.
 *
 * A core principle of GAP is to avoid custom client-side Javascript. As such,
 * use of GAPPRoxy in production is *strong discouraged*.
