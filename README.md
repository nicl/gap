# GAP

## Design goals

Guardian Accelerated Pages (GAP) is an AMP-inspired system to manage client-side
performance.

It has slightly different design goals from AMP though:

* designed to meet current Guardian requirements
* extensions can be used without being accepted as official
* not-mobile specific

So it's a bit more relaxed than AMP, which should make it a better fit for existing news-sites, which often have requirements that don't fit within AMP. The downside is it is easier to mess up performance/do the wrong thing in GAP.

Like AMP, Gap is a combination of HTML-guidelines/restrictions, and a Javascript runtime ('gap-core') augmented by custom elements ('extensions').

## How to use

As a minimum, include gap-core in your page. This must be loaded *before*
extensions. `defer` is a good way to achieve this. E.g. in your page head:

    <script defer src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/com-gu-gap/v0/gap-core.js" />
    .. // some extensions

# Performance testing

Questions to answer:

* how do extensions compose and how does this perform?
* what happens with lots of components on the page?

Behaviours we want to see:

* no forced re-style/flows
* lazy loading elements not in the viewport
* minimise number of paints
* batch network calls (NOPE - browser cache can handle that)
* easy to see in the console what is going on

Mechanisms:

* generate page with lots of elements
